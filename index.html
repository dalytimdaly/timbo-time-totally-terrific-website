            About "Timbo Timboni"
        </p>

        <p id="timbo">
            Timbo Timboni, sadly, is a psuedonym for Tim Daly, a current student and aspiring Software Engineer currently studying at the Flatiron School
            Denver. Tim Daly was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA and earned his B.A. in Environmental Science from Willamette University (Salem, OR) in 2015.
        </p>   
      
        <p>
            After graduating from Willamette, he pursued a career in Environmental Education and worked across the West Coast of the U.S. until 2022. However,
            the call of the mountains was too strong, which has brought him to Denver, CO where he currently resides. His hobbies include mountaineering, rock climbing,
            asset trading and a re-awakened interest in coding. 
        </p>  
        
        <p>
            His favorite video game is a riveting adventure called "Rock Dodger!", and a beta version is featured below.
